# Image Caption Generator

This repository contains an implementation of an Image Caption Generator using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset and utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

## Overview

The project includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Downloading and preprocessing the Flickr8k dataset.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using a pre-trained CNN to extract features from images.
3. **Model Training**: Training an RNN to generate captions based on image features.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on a validation set.
5. **Inference**: Generating captions for new images.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-caption-generator.git
   cd image-caption-generator
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Flickr8k dataset**:
   Ensure you have a Kaggle account and the necessary API credentials. Then, run the following commands:
   ```sh
   !pip install kaggle
   !mkdir ~/.kaggle
   !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   !kaggle datasets download -d adityajn105/flickr8k
   !unzip flickr8k.zip
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   Open the `Image_caption_generator.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to execute each cell.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Load the dataset**:
   ```python
   # Code to load and preprocess the dataset
   ```

2. **Extract features**:
   ```python
   # Code to extract features from images
   ```

### Model Training

1. **Train the model**:
   ```python
   # Code to train the RNN model
   ```

2. **Plot training loss**:
   ```python
   plt.plot(loss_plot)
   plt.xlabel('Epochs')
   plt.ylabel('Loss')
   plt.title('Loss Plot')
   plt.show()
   ```

### Evaluation and Inference

1. **Evaluate the model**:
   ```python
   # Code to evaluate the model on the validation set
   ```

2. **Generate captions**:
   ```python
   # Code to generate captions for new images
   ```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the trained model to generate captions for an image:

```python
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
caption = generate_caption(image_path)
print('Generated Caption:', caption)
```
