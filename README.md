# Image Caption Generator

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates an Image Caption Generator using deep learning techniques. The notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to build and train a model to generate captions for images, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and inference.

## Contents

- `Image_caption_generator.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that covers the entire process of implementing the Image Caption Generator.
  - **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial data loading and basic exploratory data analysis.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare the data for modeling, including image preprocessing and text tokenization.
  - **Model Architecture**: Building the encoder-decoder model using CNNs and RNNs.
  - **Model Training**: Training the model on the dataset.
  - **Inference and Caption Generation**: Using the trained model to generate captions for new images.
  - **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using BLEU scores and visualizing the results.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- tensorflow
